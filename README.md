# Bitcoin-Price-Notification

In this project, I built a python script that will keep track of the latest bitcoin price. And it will send you a telegram message every 30 minutes (you can tweak that) with the latest 6 bitcoin prices (again you can tweak that too). You can set a minimum threshold value so that if the BTC price goes below that threshold, then the script will send an immediate alert message showing the price.
